# IAMYOU - Consciousness Game
So, if we pretend our creative subconscious is another person, what is that per- son like? You might already have a mental picture of yours. Here are some common characteristics of the creative subconscious that most people seem to share:

Can’t talk, or at least chooses not to. Not in words, anyway. Tends to communi- cate through imagery and emotions.

q Impulsive.

Tends not to plan ahead, tends to live in the moment.

Emotional. Gets swept up in whatever you are feeling — happy, angry, excited, afraid — the subconscious seems to feel things more deeply and more powerfully than the conscious mind.

Playful. It has a constant curiosity, and loves wordplay and pranks.

Irrational. Not bound by logic and rationality, the subconscious comes up with ideas that often make no sense. Need to go to the moon? Perhaps a long ladder will work. Sometimes these ideas are a useless distraction, but sometimes they are the clever perspective you have sought all along — whoever heard of a ring molecule, for example?
